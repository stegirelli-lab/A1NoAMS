# A1NoAMS
This project is created to manually change colors on the Bambulab A1 without AMS. 
The code is based on the work of eukatree https://github.com/eukatree/Bambu_CustomGCode/ and Dennis-Q https://github.com/Dennis-Q/bambu. 
The code replaces (at your own risk) the G-code in the printer settings under "filament change." Color changes can also occur within a layer. 
When the printer pauses, select the unload function from the menu. To load, simply insert the filament and extrude slightly. 
The code purges the old color until the new color is added.
